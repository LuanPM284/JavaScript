### Aula 01
The basis of web:

Client ( pc, smartphone) x Server ( provides a service (data), video, apps, etc...) => by a browser

Website development :
- HTML : text, images, url, content
- CSS : colors, positions, dimenssions, sizes, prettier
- JavaScript : interactions, configurations, distribution, security, communication

What is JS and how it is used?
- Technology for client side ( for it's start, now it can be server too)
- Who uses? Everyone !!

Some simple code that JS can use to modify an existing webpage( google for the exemple)

```JS
// F12 for dev tools or inspect by using right click

// it will show a pop-up with the message
alert('Hello world')

// it will change the background style color
document.body.style.background = 'black'

// use selecting tool on the logo image to find the name, change to a grayscale
document.querrySelector('img#lnXdpd').style.filter = 'grayscale(100%)'

// same as before, bur hides the logo
document.querrySelector('img#lnXdpd').style.visibility = 'hidden'

// these changes are only for the client, and will be removed once the website is updated (since a current version is called from the server)
```
